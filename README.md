# CS50P – Introduction to Programming with Python (Harvard University)

This repository contains my work for **Harvard’s CS50P**, including weekly problem sets and a final project.

## 📂 Structure
- **/psets** -> Problem sets 0–8
  - Each folder contains my solutions for that week’s exercises.
- **/CS50_final_project**-> My final project for the course

## 🧑‍💻 Topics Covered
Over the 9 weeks of CS50P, I learned and applied:
- Variables, conditionals, loops
- Functions and exceptions
- File I/O and unit testing
- Libraries and APIs
- Regular expressions
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data structures (lists, dicts, sets)
- Final project design and implementation

## 🚀 Final Project
My final project is located in the `/CS50_final_project` folder called `project.py`.
See the project’s README for details about functionality, design choices, and what I learned from the project.

📌 This repo showcases my journey through CS50P - from problem sets that built up fundamentals to a final project applying everything I learned.
